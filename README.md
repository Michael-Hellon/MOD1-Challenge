# MOD1-Challenge

## Description

For this project I was given code for a Webpage. My task was to refractor the code to clean it up without changing its functionality.

- My main goal and purpose was to clean up the semantic HTML elements, and the CSS Stylesheet. Both had strucutural flaws needing to be address.
- I did this project to clean up the code and of the give HTML/CSS and to build in more functionality to the product for my client.
- This project fixes the accessibility standards and the semantic HTML elements so that it is optimized for search engines, given the fact that the client specializes in Search Engine Optimization. This project solves what could be an embarrassing problem for their own online reputation and brand identity. This will help the client lower costs and improve their income stream by fortifying their brand image.
- What I learned I learn from this project. When I initially looked at the given code, I thought it was a mess. After closer review I determined that the given code was good, and just needed some minor tweaks instead of a complete re-write. Those minor changes and restructuring really added up to a product that I think the client will be happy with. I was given the autonomy to make the changes I felt were necessary to meet the clientâ€™s intent for the final product.
