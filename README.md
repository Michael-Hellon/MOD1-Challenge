# MOD1-Challenge

## Description

For this project I was given code for a Webpage with a lot of bugs. My task was to refractor the code to clean it up without changing its functionality.

- My main goal and purpose was to clean up the semantic HTML elements, at the start there were a lot of < div > elements. The CSS styl;e sheet needs some fine tuning also.
- I did this project to test my knowledge of HTML/CSS and to build in more functionality to the page.
- This project fixes the accessibility standards and the semantic HTML elements so that it is optimized for search engines
- What did I learn?
